# NStateManager
Easy to use and very flexible state manager for .Net.

Features
- Simple interface so it's easy to get started
- State management and trigger/event processing are decoupled to simplify configuration
- Stateless so it can be used as a shared resource or embedded as part of managed entity
- Full async/await support, including cancellation and ConfigureAwait
- Lots of options for defining what happens when triggers/events occur and entering, reentering, or exiting states.

Still lots to do to get this rolling, so here's the current to-do list in priority order
- Finish Sale example
- Finish unit tests
- Finish this readme
- Create Nuget package
- Lots of documentation
- More examples and docs...
